Overview
--------
This document contains plain-English manual test cases for the Login functionality. Each test case includes an ID, objective, preconditions, test data, step-by-step actions, expected results, pass/fail criteria, postconditions, and notes.

TC_Login_001 — Login with valid credentials

- Pass: Both validations are shown and login is prevented.

TC_Login_007 — SQL injection attempt
Objective:
- Verify inputs are sanitized and SQL injection strings do not bypass authentication.
Preconditions:
- App reachable (perform tests in a test environment).
Test Data Examples:
- Username: ' OR '1'='1
- Password: ' OR '1'='1
Steps:
1. Open Login page.
2. Enter the injection payload in username and/or password.
3. Click Login.
Expected Results:
- Login fails; application returns a safe error (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
- No DB error messages or stack traces are exposed.
Pass/Fail:
- Pass: Injection fails and no sensitive info is leaked.
Notes:
- Capture server logs if possible to confirm no SQL errors.

TC_Login_008 — Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) attempt in username
Objective:
- Verify inputs are sanitized and script payloads are not executed.
Preconditions:
- App reachable.
Test Data:
- Username: <script>alert(1)</script>
- Password: pass
Steps:
1. Open Login page.
2. Enter the XSS payload in the username field and valid/any password.
3. Click Login.
Expected Results:
- Payload is treated as text; no script executes in the browser.
- If echoed back, it should be HTML‑encoded.
Pass/Fail:
- Pass: No script execution observed.
Notes:
- Watch browser console for any unexpected JS execution or errors.

TC_Login_009 — Extremely long input
Objective:
- Verify application handles very long input strings without crashing or leaking info.
Preconditions:
- App reachable.
Test Data:
- Username: 5000-character 'a' string
- Password: 5000-character 'b' string
Steps:
1. Open Login page.
2. Enter the long strings and click Login.
Expected Results:
- Input is rejected or handled gracefully (truncated/validated); app remains responsive.
- No server errors or stack traces shown.
Pass/Fail:
- Pass: Application remains stable and shows an appropriate error.

TC_Login_010 — Leading/trailing whitespace handling
Objective:
- Verify whether username/password inputs are trimmed according to system policy.

Test Data:
- Username: " user " (spaces around)
- Password: " pass "
Steps:
1. Open Login page.
2. Enter credentials with leading/trailing spaces and click Login.
Expected Results:
- If system trims: login succeeds. If system treats spaces as significant: login fails. Document observed behavior.
Pass/Fail:

TC_Login_011 — Special characters in password

TC_Login_013 — Case sensitivity of username/password

Test Data:
- Username variants: myuser, MYUSER
- Password variants: mypass, MYPASS
Steps:
1. Attempt login using different case combinations for username and password.
Expected Results:
- Document whether username is case-insensitive (if applicable) and password is case-sensitive (recommended).
Pass/Fail:
- Pass: Behavior matches documented policy.

TC_Login_014 — Time‑based injection / slow query attempt
Objective:
- Verify backend does not hang or degrade when given time‑based injection attempts (test only in safe test environments).
Preconditions:
- App reachable; test environment only.
Test Data:
- Payloads crafted to attempt slow SQL (use with extreme caution).
Steps:
1. Enter time-delay payloads in input fields and click Login.
Expected Results:
- System responds normally without excessive delay; request rejected and no resource exhaustion.
Pass/Fail:
- Pass: System remains responsive and rejects the payload.
Notes:
- Only perform in controlled test environments; do not run in production.

Optional checks to consider with many of the above test cases
- Verify HTTP status codes for API-based logins (e.g., 200 success, 401 unauthorized).
- Confirm CSRF tokens are present on the login form.
- After successful login, check cookies for Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite flags.
- Attempt navigation to a protected resource to verify session/authentication.
